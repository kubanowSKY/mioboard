Simulate keyboard (3 keys) using EMG signal.

# What actually works:

	Simulation keyboard movements for 26.5 seconds from sample movements of hand
	Playable game included

# What does it do now:

	Averages probes
	Filters 50 Hz from probes
	Bandpass 10-45 Hz from probes
	Loads prepared movement samples (hand-close, index)
	During steering_test it simulates keyboard for 26.5 seconds
